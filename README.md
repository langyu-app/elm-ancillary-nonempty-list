## Introduction

This package provides additional convenience functions not found in
[mgold/elm-nonempty-list](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mgold/elm-nonempty-list/latest/)
for working with lists that are guaranteed (at compile time) to be non-empty.
As with all, `elm-ancillary-*` packages, these began as functions we've found
useful for `langyu` but often include additional functions.

## Installation

```bash
elm install langyu-app/elm-ancillary-nonempty-list
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, so long as it has the potential to be generally
useful and isn't found already in `mgold/elm-nonempty-list`.
